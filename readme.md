Hello, this project is about developing backend system where it uses various chunking methods, embedding models of different provider and comparision with various searching algorithms techniques. 

In this project, I used Pinecone vector db. Generally, it has two api: one is for applying various chunking methods and embedding models. Another one is for rag-based system and compares various comparision vector searching algorithms. Also, another api for booking the interview details and sending the confirmation to the provided emails.

To run this program, please follow the steps given below:
step 1: Intalls the required libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file
step 2: Run the command:uviconr main:app --reload 
step 3: After running in the browser: provide the url 127.0.0.1/docs. There you will three apis and provide the details accordingly.

Thank you
